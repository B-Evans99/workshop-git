# Git Workshop

This is a simple introduction to git and github. We'll be making several
branches and commits to files in this very repository. Everything will be in
markdown, so you won't need to know any specific language (other than markdown
obviously).

Let's learn some git!

**NOTE** Some of this is probably going to seem incomplete. You are going to
help build this workshop! You'll see **WIP** scattered about. That just means
the section is Work In Progress.

## Forks

**WIP**

Just like a fork in a path, a repository fork is the start of a new bit of code
but it shares the same history as the original code base.

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your local machine

## Repositories

**WIP**

Repositories are where your code physically resides. Local, remote, on your
computer, in Github.

> Question: Name all the repositories that share a common history with this
> code base

## Branches

**WIP**

Branches are kind of like forks, but they are contained withn a repository.
Branches are cheap, so we want to use them often.

**WIP** When should we branch?

Let's add some files that link to other great programming resources on the web.

TODO: Add commands to branch here

1. Create a new branch
2. Make a new file

## Commits

**WIP**

Commits are little saved change to a repository. They also _communicate_ to
your fellow teammates and your future self.

1. Add an interesting resource to your file.
2. Commit that change.
3. Add a link to your file from this README file
4. Commit that change.

**Note**: Use good communication skills.

> Question: What are some examples of good commit messages?
